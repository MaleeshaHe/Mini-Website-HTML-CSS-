						Rambukkana Deliwala Kotawehera is located in Deliwala village in a 3 km distance from Kurunegala road across Dombemada from Rambukkana town in Rambukkana Divional Secretariat.
						This place of worship which is located rather higher from ground level can be sighted even from distant. It is mentioned that the sanctuary, which belongs to 1st B.C. century, was erected in the reign of King Dewanampiyathissa (250-210 B.C.). It has been set up concurrently with “Mihinthalaya Mihindu Maha Seya” that is considered to be the most ancient stupa in Sri Lanka. The gigantic stupa named “Deliwala Kotawehera” would measure 335 cubits around and 80 cubits high. Even after decaying, it stands tall and thick resembling the genera of the biggest stupa in Sri Lanka

						The Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe Rajamaha Vihara is a foremost Buddhist Vihara in Rambukkana. The Maha Pirivena at the Vihara provides education to monks and lay students. The Vihara is closely connected to the Buddhist renaissance of the Kandy period. The commencement of current Vihara is attributed to the Rev. Kadiragoda Medhankare, a member of the community led by Welivita Sri Saranankara Upali Thera who brought the practice of higher ordination from Siam and established the sima (limits for monastic rites) at this temple and granted higher ordination to 10 monks. But according to folklore, the history of this temple goes as far as king Vijayabahu III (1232-1236) where he is supposed to have built a 3 storied image house at this temple.
